#Purpose: This is exploratory R script as a learning process that uses a data set of interest to the Snow project. Secondarily, it loads the cleaned master 13C soil and phloem isotope data into an R data frame, and analyzes and plots some of the the data.

#load data using read table into a dataframe called "iphloem"
iphloem = read.table("data/13C//Phloem13C_master.csv", na.strings=c('.'), stringsAsFactors=FALSE, head=TRUE, sep=",")

#input file asks r to assign data with characters in it as char - NOT FACTORS |stringsAsFactors=FALSE | but Treatment and DOY need to be defines as factors for ANOVA analyses - so we'll designate them as such: 
iphloem$Treatment=as.factor(iphloem$Treatment)
iphloem$DOY=as.factor(iphloem$DOY)

#It would be useful to develop an apply function or a for loop to run multiple ANOVA's and create plots on variables relevant to the hypotheses you would like to test. I have a sense you'd vectorize your dependent variables to start, but not sure how to get there....dplyr?

#####################################Let's Graph!#########################################################
#Some easy graphs in the base r package:

#Simple scatterplot matrices for visualizing the data (all):
pairs(~DOY+Treatment+d13C+WtpN+WtpC+CNratio,data=iphloem, 
      main="Simple Scatterplot Matrix")
#simplified by treatment
pairs(~Treatment+d13C+WtpN+WtpC+CNratio,data=iphloem, 
      main="Simple Scatterplot Matrix")

# Boxplot of d13C by Treatment 
boxplot(d13C ~ Treatment, data=iphloem, main="Phloem d13C by Snow Treatment", 
        xlab="Snow Treatment", ylab="Phloem d13C (per mil)")
# Boxplot of Percent C by Treatment 
boxplot(WtpC ~ Treatment, data=iphloem, main="Phloem Percent C by Snow Treatment", 
        xlab="Snow Treatment", ylab="Phloem C(%)")
# Boxplot of Percent N by Treatment 
boxplot(WtpN ~ Treatment, data=iphloem, main="Phloem Percent N by Snow Treatment", 
        xlab="Snow Treatment", ylab="Phloem N (%)")
# Boxplot of C:N by Treatment 
boxplot(CNratio ~ Treatment, data=iphloem, main="Phloem C:N by Snow Treatment", 
        xlab="Snow Treatment", ylab="Phloem C:N")
# Boxplot of d13C by DOY 
boxplot(d13C ~ DOY, data=iphloem, main="Phloem d13C by day of year", 
        xlab="Day of Year", ylab="d13C (per mil)")
# Boxplot of %C by DOY 
boxplot(WtpC ~ DOY, data=iphloem, main="Phloem percent C by day of year", 
        xlab="Day of Year", ylab="C (%)")
# Boxplot of %N by DOY 
boxplot(WtpN ~ DOY, data=iphloem, main="Phloem percent N by day of year", 
        xlab="Day of Year", ylab="N (%)")
# Boxplot of C:N by DOY 
boxplot(CNratio ~ DOY, data=iphloem, main="Phloem C:N by day of year", 
        xlab="Day of Year", ylab="C:N")

#OK, so how about the mean and the confidence interval and the standard error? Here's one example that uses the package 'sciplot', A collection of functions that creates graphs with error bars for data collected from one-way or higher factorial designs: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sciplot/index.html
#example code###############
#install.packages("sciplot")
#library(sciplot)
#bargraph.CI(
  #class,  #categorical factor for the x-axis
  #hwy,    #numerical DV for the y-axis
  #year,   #grouping factor
  #legend=T, 
  #x.leg=19,
  #ylab="Highway MPG",
  #xlab="Class")

library(sciplot)
#plotting mean and CI of d13C over DOY grouped by treatment
bargraph.CI(iphloem$DOY,iphloem$d13C,iphloem$Treatment,legend=TRUE,ylab="Phloem d13C (permil)", xlab = "Snow Treatment by DOY", ylim = c(-30,-25), y.leg = -28)

#######ggplot2########################
#So ggplot2 appears to be a common powerful and preferred graphics package.  Let's learn some! (adapted fromhttp://www.r-bloggers.com/basic-introduction-to-ggplot2/ and https://github.com/echen/ggplot2-tutorial
#Verdict = qplot kicks ass, except for barplots 

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

#histogram
qplot(data=iphloem, x = d13C, main = "Histogram of d13C")

#basic scatter organized by color, then size
qplot(data=iphloem, x = DOY, y= d13C, color=Treatment)
# By setting the alpha of each point to 0.7, we reduce the effects of overplotting points.
qplot(data=iphloem, x = Treatment, y= d13C, color=WtpC, size=DOY, alpha = I(0.7))
#adding labels
qplot(data=iphloem, x = Treatment, y= d13C, color=WtpC, size=DOY, alpha = I(0.7), xlab= "Snow Treatment", ylab= "d13C(per mil)", main = "Phloem d13C, percent C and day of year by snowpack treatment")

#box plot
qplot(data=iphloem, x= Treatment, y=d13C, geom="boxplot")

#looking at %C vs d13C faceted into seperate plots over the various snow treatments, color coded by DOY
qplot(data=iphloem, x=WtpC, y=d13C,color=DOY,facets = ~Treatment)

#adding transformation layers- in this case a statistical trend line
#1) Convert plot into a variable
Awesomeplot1 <- qplot(data=iphloem, x=WtpC, y=d13C,color=Treatment,facets = ~Treatment)
#2) Add a layer: (OLS trendline)
Awesomeplot1 <- Awesomeplot1 + stat_smooth(method="lm")

#barcbart of d13C means
#This actually gets complicated. . .I couldn't figure out how to do this in qplot, but used our summary data generated by the ddply() and ggplot2; this requires your data to be in the "long" format; see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_means_and_error_bars_(ggplot2)/
